    "faqData_qes1" : "Who can donate blood?",
    "faqData_ans1" : "A blood donor must: be in good general health be aged 18 years or older but less than 60 years weigh at least 45 Kg have a hemoglobin level of at least 12.5 g/dl not have donated blood in the last 3 months",
    "faqData_qes2" : "Who cannot donate blood?",
    "faqData_ans2" : "Blood must not be donated if a person is suffering from any of these conditions: Cold/ fever in the past 1 week Under treatment with antibiotics or any other medication Cardiac problems, hypertension, epilepsy, diabetes (on insulin therapy), history of cancer, chronic kidney or liver disease, bleeding tendencies, venereal disease Major surgery in the last 6 months or minor surgery in the past 3 months Jaundice or hepatitis or positivity for Hepatitis B or C viruses Tooth extraction less than 3 days back or dental surgery less than 1 month back Fainting attacks during the last donation On therapy with regular blood transfusions Sharing needles to inject drugs/ having history of drug addiction Sexual relations with different partners or with a high risk individual Been tested positive for antibodies to HIV Any endocrinal problem Females should not donate blood during pregnancy. They can donate after 6 months following delivery and when they are not breast feeding Females should not donate blood if they are having heavy menstrual flow or menstrual cramps Miscarriage in the last 6 months",
    "faqData_qes3" : "How does one make sure that the blood is safe for patients?",
    "faqData_ans3" : "Some diseases can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Therefore, all donated blood is screened for transfusion transmissible diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Syphilis and Malaria. Even with testing, sometimes infections are not detected, although the rate of detection is extremely good with better methods of testing (e.g. NAT).",
    "faqData_qes4" : "How often can I donate blood?",
    "faqData_ans4" : "It is safe to donate blood once in every three months.",
    "faqData_qes5" : "Why do I have to wait 3 months before donating again?",
    "faqData_ans5" : "Since blood contains iron (which is essential for making new red blood cells), donating blood more often than every 3 months causes the body to lose iron faster than it can be made up from iron-containing foods in our diet. As a result the donor could develop iron deficiency anemia, causing him/her to feel weak and tired.",
    "faqData_qes6" : "Why is it important to donate blood?",
    "faqData_ans6" : "Blood can be a life-saving therapy for patients. One unit of blood can save 4 lives (if it is separated into components). Healthy people should donate blood regularly and voluntarily to overcome shortage of blood for patients. It has been proven worldwide that voluntary donations are the safest of all kinds of donations.",
    "faqData_qes7" : "Why are replacement/directed and paid donations not safe?",
    "faqData_ans7" : "Replacement donations are donations in which the patient is asked to arrange blood for him/herself. If the blood group of the donor and the patient match, the blood is transfused (directed donations). If they do not match, the blood is stocked and a group-match blood is issued (replacement donations). Replacement donations have a higher rate of transfusion transmissible infections than voluntary donations. Paid donations are highly unsafe because they are usually given by people for ulterior motives (e.g. drug addicts) and have a very high rate of transfusion transmissible infections. Even the most sophisticated methods of testing available may fail to detect such infections. Therefore, it is important that voluntary donations by anonymous donors, for altruistic reasons are promoted.",
    "faqData_qes8" : "What if I faint during a blood donation?",
    "faqData_ans8" : "The likelihood of this happening is minimal. You should eat before donating and drink extra fluids, especially after donation.",
    "faqData_qes9" : "Will a blood donation hurt?",
    "faqData_ans9" : "Giving blood is not painful. You may feel a prick when the needle is inserted, which lasts only a few seconds.",
    "faqData_qes10" : "Will I become weak if I donate frequently?",
    "faqData_ans10" : "No. It is perfectly healthy to donate blood once every 3 months.",
    "faqData_qes11" : "Will I get AIDS if I donate blood?",
    "faqData_ans11" : "Absolutely not! All equipment used to collect blood are sterile. These items are used once and discarded.",
    "faqData_qes12" : "What are the components of blood and how are they used?",
    "faqData_ans12" : "There are four components in blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma. Red blood cells supply oxygen to various parts of the body. White blood cells fight against disease or infections. Plasma carries nutrients, clotting factors and enzymes. Platelets help clot the blood to prevent excessive bleeding. Today, doctors transfuse individual blood components based upon the patientâ€™s needs. Major categories of patient needs include: cancer therapy, organ transplants, accident victims and people undergoing elective surgical procedures.",
    "faqData_qes13" : "How long can blood be stored?",
    "faqData_ans13" : "Red cells - 35 days Platelets - 5 days Fresh frozen plasma - 1 year",
    "faqData_qes14" : "How long does it take to give blood?",
    "faqData_ans14" : "Typically only about one hour.",
    "faqData_qes15" : "Which Blood Group can donate to which blood group?",
    "faqData_ans15" : "O-: Universal donor (can donate to all blood groups: O-, O+, A-, A+, B-, B+, AB-, AB+)\nO+: Can donate to O+, A+, B+, AB+\nA-: Can donate to A-, A+, AB-, AB+\nA+: Can donate to A+, AB+\nB-: Can donate to B-, B+, AB-, AB+\nB+: Can donate to B+, AB+\nAB-: Can donate to AB- and AB+\nAB+: Universal recipient (can only donate to AB+)",
