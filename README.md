The iDonate Life mobile application is developed to facilitate and streamline the blood 
donation process, catering to the needs of donors, recipients, administrators, and healthcare 
providers. The app allows donors to register, update their profiles, view donation history, 
and respond to donation requests. Recipients can request blood, track their request status, 
and update request details. Centers manage users, view analytics, manage appointments , 
view donor information, and manage donation requests.
The primary goal of iDonate Life is to encourage blood donation by making the process 
more accessible and efficient. The app uses Firebase as its backend database to ensure 
secure and real-time data management. Key features include user authentication, profile 
management, real-time search for nearby donation requests, and comprehensive 
administrative controls and chat feature. iDonate Life aims to build a supportive 
community around blood donation, addressing logistical challenges and promoting a 
culture of giving. Future enhancements could include the integration of machine learning 
to predict blood demand and supply trends and expanding the platform to support organ 
donations. This project not only improves the efficiency of blood donation systems but also
fosters a sense of community and support.
